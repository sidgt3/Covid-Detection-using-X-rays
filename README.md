# Covid-Detection-using-X-rays
Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images by using Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning


Inside this we will see:

1.Sample an open source dataset of X-ray images for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19

2.Sample “normal” (i.e., not infected) X-ray images from healthy patients

3.Train a CNN to automatically detect COVID-19 in X-ray images via the dataset we created

4.Evaluate the results from an educational perspective

For the purposes of this tutorial, I thought to explore X-ray images as doctors frequently use X-rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes.

Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patient’s lungs.
